                Kifli or kipfel is a traditional yeast bread roll that is rolled and formed into a crescent shape before
                baking. Crescent-shaped pastries are considered the oldest surviving pastry shape and are believed to
                represent an ancient pagan tradition involving offerings to the moon goddess, Selene. Pastries of
                similar shape have been baked since at least the 10th century. Kifli was likely traditionally baked in
                monasteries for Easter. It is a common type of bread roll throughout much of central Europe and nearby
                countries, where it is called by various names. It is likely the inspiration for the French croissant,
                which has a similar shape but is made with a different type of dough.

                Football is a family of team sports that involve, to varying degrees, kicking a ball to
                score a goal. Unqualified, the word football normally means the form of football that is the most
                popular where the word is used. Sports commonly called football include association football (known as
                soccer in some countries); gridiron football (specifically American football or Canadian football);
                Australian rules football; rugby football (either rugby league or rugby union); and Gaelic
                football. These various forms of football are known as football codes.

            <p class="maintext"> Football is a family of team sports that involve, to varying degrees, kicking a ball to
                score a goal. Unqualified, the word football normally means the form of football that is the most
                popular where the word is used. Sports commonly called football include association football (known as
                soccer in some countries); gridiron football (specifically American football or Canadian football);
                Australian rules football; rugby football (either rugby league or rugby union); and Gaelic
                football. These various forms of football are known as football codes.

                There are a number of references to traditional, ancient, or prehistoric ball games played in many
                different parts of the world. Contemporary codes of football can be traced back to the
                codification of these games at English public schools during the 19th century. The expansion of
                the British Empire allowed these rules of football to spread to areas of British influence outside the
                directly controlled Empire. By the end of the 19th century, distinct regional codes were already
                developing: Gaelic football, for example, deliberately incorporated the rules of local traditional
                football games in order to maintain their heritage. In 1888, The Football League was founded in
                England, becoming the first of many professional football competitions. During the 20th century, several
                of the various kinds of football grew to become some of the most popular team sports in the world.
